# ⚠️ Document Moved

This document has been **archived** and consolidated.

## New Location
All planning and roadmap information is now in:

**[PLAN.md](../PLAN.md)** - Comprehensive 6-phase implementation plan

## What Happened?
As part of Phase 1.1 (Document Consolidation), 17 scattered plan files were consolidated into 6 canonical documents:
- `README.md` - Entry point
- `PLAN.md` - Roadmap and phases
- `AUDIT.md` - Evidence-based findings
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System overview
- `REFERENCE.md` - Env vars, API, commands
- `SMOKE_TEST.md` - Critical endpoint tests

This stub will be removed after 1-2 weeks once the team adapts to the new structure.
